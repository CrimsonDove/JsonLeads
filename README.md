JsonLeads
=========

A php script that generates a json data sheet based on Cpalead surveys.

This script is designed for websites using CPAlead survey gateways. It was designed to allow web developers to integrate the suerveys for seamlessly into their websites without the use of the stupid iFrame CPAlead makes you use. It is still very functional and usefull. 

Look at test.php for an example on how to use the script.
